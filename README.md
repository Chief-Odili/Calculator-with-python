# 🧮 Chief Odili Calculator  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Chief Odili Calculator is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Addition (`+`)  
- Subtraction (`-`)  
- Multiplication (`*`)  
- Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero  
- Input validation to ensure only numeric values are processed  
- Recursion to allow multiple calculations in a single session  

## 🔧 How to Use  
1. Run the program in a Python environment:  
   ```bash
